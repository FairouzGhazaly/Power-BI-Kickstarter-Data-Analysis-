# ðŸ“Š Kickstarter Data Analysis with Power BI

## Overview

This project explores **Kickstarter crowdfunding data** to identify trends, successful project categories, and funding patterns. Using **Power BI**, I transformed raw data into an **interactive dashboard** that allows users to drill down into categories, track funding performance, and analyze project outcomes.

The main goals were:

* Understand what types of projects succeed the most.
* Explore when the highest pledges and backers were recorded.
* Build a professional **interactive visualization** for decision-making and storytelling.


## Dataset Details

The dataset contains information about Kickstarter projects, including:

* **Project Information:** Category, Subcategory, Country, Launch & Deadline dates
* **Performance Metrics:** Goal amount, Pledged amount, Number of backers, and State (successful/failed/canceled)

## Project Highlights

1. **Data Transformation**

   * Cleaned raw Kickstarter dataset in Power Query.
   * Removed unnecessary columns.
   * Created a **category hierarchy** (Category â†’ Subcategory) for better drill-down analysis.

2. **DAX Measures**

   * Created custom DAX measures to track:

     * Total Projects
     * Total Backers
     * Total Pledged Amount
   * Built KPI cards to summarize these metrics.

3. **Interactive Visuals**

   * Drill-down charts to explore trends across categories and time periods.
   * Trend analysis for pledged amounts and backers.
   * Slicer filters for dynamic exploration (e.g., by category, subcategory, state, or year).

4. **Key Insights**

   * Identified which categories and subcategories have the **highest success rates**.
   * Discovered **time periods** with the most successful campaigns.
   * Compared pledged vs. goal amounts to evaluate funding efficiency.


## Outcome

The Power BI dashboard provided a **comprehensive overview** of crowdfunding activity on Kickstarter, highlighting the dynamics of project success and failure.

* Stakeholders can now quickly see **which project types attract the most funding**.
* Investors and creators can analyze **seasonal and categorical trends** to make informed decisions.
* Demonstrates strong skills in **Power BI**, **data cleaning**, **DAX**, and **interactive dashboarding**.
